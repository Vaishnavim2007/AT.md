# **Embedded**
# AT 
METHODS: <br/>
•Connect the microcontroller to the laptop and open PuTTY and configure the connection settings <br/>
          Connection type: Serial <br/>
          Port speed: 115200 <br/>
          Device address: /dev/ttyUSB0 (we will get it by checking the ip address) <br/>
•Open the serial connection and establish communication with the microcontroller <br/>
•Then by using the hint provided we need to enter ap command    suitable for it and then we will get new hint and enter the appropriate ap command to progress through the challenge.<br/>
•Receive and analyze subsequent hints, using them to guide further command entries and flag retrieval.<br/>
WHAT I LEARNED: <br/>
•Were able to know about AT commands and became familiar with many commands <br/>
Usually AT commands are used to communicate and control modems <br/>
•We will learn how to use PuTTY to establish a serial connection with a microcontroller <br/>
•Also we will understand how to open and manage a serial connection to communicate with a microcontroller. This involves sending commands and receiving responses via the serial interface<br/>
